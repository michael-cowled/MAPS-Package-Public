\usage{
make_plots(
  final.annotation.df,
  folder,
  remove_sample = NULL,
  ms2query_threshold = 0.7,
  noise_area_threshold = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{final.annotation.df}{A data frame containing processed feature annotations.
Must include 'feature.ID', 'Samples', and 'compound.name'.}

\item{folder}{Path to the main output directory where plots and data are saved
and where 'ms2query/' and 'mzmine/' subdirectories are expected.}

\item{remove_sample}{Optional sample name to exclude from cumulative histogram analysis
(e.g., crude). Defaults to NULL, meaning no sample is excluded.}

\item{ms2query_threshold}{MS2Query model prediction threshold (default 0.7).}

\item{noise_area_threshold}{Peak area threshold for quantification data (default 10000).}
}
\value{
A list containing the processed data frames generated by each plot function:
'barchart_data', 'histogram_data', and 'bubblechart_data'.
}
\description{
Executes a sequence of three plotting functions: barchart of total annotations,
cumulative histogram of unique annotations, and a bubble chart of metabolite classes
derived from MS2Query data. Handles conditional loading of metadata and checks for
common quantification file spelling errors.
